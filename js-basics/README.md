This lesson covers the basics of JavaScript, the language that provides interactivity on the web.

## Variables

Variables store values that can be used and changed throughout your code.

Creating and **declaring** a variable is made up of two parts:

 1. Keywords `let` or `var`.
 1. The variable name

`let myVariable;`

`myVariable` has now been declared, but it currently doesn't have a value. Store a value in a variable with the `=` operator, followed by the expected value.

`myVariable = 123;`

`myVariable` has now been **initialized** with the value 123.

We can also do declaration and initialization of a variable in one line.

`let myVariable = 123;`

## Data Types

Variables can store many different types of values, like numbers and text. These various types of values are known as the **data type**. Data types are an important part of software development because it helps developers make decisions on how the code should be written and how the software should run.

### Numbers

In the previous section, the value of `myVariable` was a number data type.

`let myVariable = 123;`

Variables can store all types of numbers, including decimal or negative numbers. Numbers also can be used in arithmetic operators, covered in the [next section](#operators).

### Strings


### Booleans


## Operators
