This lesson covers the basics of JavaScript, the language that provides interactivity on the web.

## Variables

Variables store values that can be used and changed throughout your code.

Creating and **declaring** a variable is made up of two parts:

 1. Keywords `let` or `var`.
 1. The variable name

`let myVariable;`

`myVariable` has now been declared, but it currently doesn't have a value. Store a value in a variable with the `=` operator, followed by the expected value.

`myVariable = 123;`

`myVariable` has now been **initialized** with the value 123.
